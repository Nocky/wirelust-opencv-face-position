Building
-----------------------------

This app requires OpenCV. I am currently using a self compiled version.

Compiling looks something like this:
* git pull git://code.opencv.org/opencv.git
* cd opencv
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* make install

To compile this app:
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
